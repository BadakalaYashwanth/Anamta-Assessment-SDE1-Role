2. PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to generate a synthetic infrared image sequence that imitates thermal camera output. The dataset includes:

- A cooler background
- One or more warmer objects
- Motion across frames
- Sensor effects such as noise and blur

The dataset is completely computer-generated and does not use real hardware.

Primary applications include:
- Machine learning and computer vision model training
- Testing IR-based detection and tracking algorithms
- Synthetic data workflows for GAN-related research

5. KEY TERMS

Infrared (IR): Invisible light used to measure heat.
Temperature Map: A grid containing temperature values per pixel.
Pixel Intensity: A brightness value from 0 to 255.
Bit Depth: The grayscale range supported by the image.
Noise: Random variation simulating real sensor behavior.
Blur: Softening of edges similar to optical spread.
Atmospheric Attenuation: Reduction in signal strength as heat travels through air.
Object Motion: Movement of the warm object between frames.
Synthetic Data: Artificially generated data rather than real camera output.

--------------------------------------------------------------
6. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The project uses object-oriented design for modularity.

Component: IRSensorConfig
Function: Defines sensor parameters
Purpose: Controls resolution, bit depth, noise, and blur

Component: IRObject
Function: Represents a warm object
Purpose: Defines shape, motion, and temperature behavior

Component: IRScene
Function: Builds the temperature map
Purpose: Combines background and objects

Component: IRDatasetGenerator
Function: Produces image frames
Purpose: Applies sensor effects and exports images

--------------------------------------------------------------
7. TEMPERATURE-TO-INTENSITY PROCESS

1. Capture temperature value
2. Clip it between minimum and maximum bounds
3. Convert it to a grayscale value from 0 to 255
4. Apply blur and noise
5. Save the result as a PNG image

Higher temperature results in a brighter pixel.
Lower temperature results in a darker pixel.

--------------------------------------------------------------
8. COMPONENT BEHAVIOR SUMMARY

IRSensorConfig:
Maintains configuration settings and enables parameter adjustments.

IRObject:
Defines position, size, shape, motion, and temperature changes.

IRScene:
Generates a gradient-based background with randomness and integrates object temperatures.

IRDatasetGenerator:
Applies attenuation, noise, blur, and quantization, then saves frames sequentially.

--------------------------------------------------------------
9. MODELED SENSOR EFFECTS

Noise: Simulates sensor imperfections.
Blur: Represents optical diffusion.
Bit-depth Quantization: Produces 8-bit grayscale output.
Attenuation: Models weakening of thermal signal through air.

These effects increase realism for algorithm testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------
10. LIMITATIONS

- Shapes are simple
- Temperature simulation is basic
- No material emissivity modeling
- No 3D depth or camera movement
